# leak-seeker
Leak Seeker allows users to search for common faults with a specific car or log a fault to see if other users have similar issues. 
To get the app started you need to create a .env file on the server side containing some variables. An example is as follows:
 
PORT={port}
PORT_TEST={test_port}
URL={database_url}
URL_TEST={test_database_url}
VEHICLECOLLECTION='vehicle'
REGCOLLECTION='reg'
